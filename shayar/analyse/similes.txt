Ah! The spider was fat. It looked funny.
I like water, as do you.
I like cookies as much as you.
Curley was flopping like a fish on a line.
The very mist on the Essex marshes was like a gauzy and radiant fabric.
Why, man, they both bestride the narrow world like a Colossus.
Vincent is as strong as a lion.
She is like a candy so sweet.
He is like a refiner's fire.
Her eyes twinkled like stars.
He fights like a lion.
He runs like a cheetah.
She is fragrant like a rose.
Gareth is like a lion when he gets angry.
For hope grew round me, like the twining vine.
And the executioner went off like an arrow.
She walks as gracefully as a cat.
He was as hungry as a lion.
He was as mean as a bull.
That spider was as fat as an elephant.
Cute as a kitten.
As busy as a bee.
As snug as a bug in a rug.
Eyes as big as dinner plates.
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
I'm happier than a tornado in a trailer park!
How this Herculean Roman does become The carriage of his chafe.
