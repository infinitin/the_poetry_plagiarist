Input seed: Limerick about a computer that is bored with data and finds poetry fun

1. 
\textit{There once was (a/an) \_\_\_\_\_ named \_\_\_\_[A]\\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_[A]\\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_[B]\\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_[B]\\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_[A]}

This is a limerick template straight out of the generation phase.

2.
\textit{There once was a computer named \_\_\_\_ [data]\\
That was bored with data [data]\\
It finds poetry fun [fun]\\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_[fun]\\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ [data]}

This step introduced the computer, the fact that it is bored with data and finds poetry fun. It does not take any structure into account when adding these.

3.
\textit{There once was a computer named Zeta\\
That was bored to death with data\\
It finds poetry fun\\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ sun\\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ beta}

This step filled in the name Zeta since it needed to rhyme with data. 
It rephrased ‘bored’ with ‘bored to death’ to fit the rhythm without losing meaning. 
Found third line to be complete.
Added sun to end of next line since it is an association with fun and follows rhyme scheme.
Added beta to end of last line since it rhymes with data (and Zeta)

4.
\textit{There once was a computer named Zeta\\
That was bored to death with data\\
It finds poetry fun\\
Like the summer sun\\
The revolutionary new system goes into beta}

This step added a simile to compare the fun of poetry to the sun since it fit the rhythm structure (alternatively, “like the scorching/setting/sinking sun”, but summer sun has alliteration on 'su' rather than just 's'). A phrase was found that ends with beta and was arbitrarily added.

5.
\textit{There once was a computer named Zeta\\
That was bored to death with data\\
It finds poetry fun\\
Like the summer sun\\
The new system goes into beta}

Redundant adjective removed to fit structure in last line. Poem finished.

Note too that we added the input data to the first three lines. Separating them out will make it more coherent, especially in longer poems. Then the associations could be found with surrounding sentences, not just the previous one.

Further rephrasing of lifted sentences, such as the last one, could be beneficial to adding randomness and creativity.

\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Edward Lear}
\ref{sec:lear}
There was an old man with a beard\\
Who said, "It's just as I feared!\\
Two owls and a hen,\\
Four larks and a wren\\
Are making a nest in my beard!"\\

There was a Young Lady of Ryde,\\
Whose shoe-strings were seldom untied.\\
She purchased some clogs,\\
And some small spotted dogs,\\
And frequently walked about Ryde.\\


There was an Old Man with a nose,\\
Who said, 'If you choose to suppose,\\
That my nose is too long,\\
You are certainly wrong!'\\
That remarkable Man with a nose.\\

There was an Old Man on a hill,\\
Who seldom, if ever, stood still;\\
He ran up and down,\\
In his Grandmother's gown,\\
Which adorned that Old Man on a hill.\\

There was a Young Lady whose bonnet,\\
Came untied when the birds sate upon it;\\
But she said: 'I don't care!\\
All the birds in the air\\
Are welcome to sit on my bonnet!'\\


There was a Young Person of Smyrna,\\
Whose Grandmother threatened to burn her;\\
But she seized on the cat,\\
And said, 'Granny, burn that!\\
You incongruous Old Woman of Smyrna!'\\


There was an Old Person of Chili,\\
Whose conduct was painful and silly,\\
He sate on the stairs,\\
Eating apples and pears,\\
That imprudent Old Person of Chili.\\


There was an Old Man with a gong,\\
Who bumped at it all day long;\\
But they called out, 'O law!\\
You're a horrid old bore!'\\
So they smashed that Old Man with a gong.\\

There was an Old Lady of Chertsey,\\
Who made a remarkable curtsey;\\
She twirled round and round,\\
Till she sunk underground,\\
Which distressed all the people of Chertsey.\\

There was an Old Man in a tree,\\
Who was horribly bored by a Bee;\\
When they said, 'Does it buzz?'\\
He replied, 'Yes, it does!'\\
'It's a regular brute of a Bee!'\\

\subsection{The Book of Limericks}
\ref{sec:book}
There was an old woman of Lynn,\\
Whose nose very near reach'd her chin;\\
You may easy suppose\\
She had plenty of beaux,\\
This charming old woman of Lynn.\\

There was an old woman of Gloster,\\
Whose parrot two guineas it cost her;\\
But his tongue never ceasing,\\
Was vastly displeasing,\\
To that talkative woman of Gloster.\\

There was a sick man of Tobago,\\
Lived long on rice-gruel and sago;\\
But at last, to his bliss,\\
The physician said this:\\
'To a roast leg of mutton you may go.'\\

There was an old miser of Reading,\\
Had a house with a yard, with a shed in;\\
'Twas meant for a cow,\\
But so small that I vow\\
The poor creature could scarce get its head in.\\

There was a young person in pink,\\
Who called out for something to drink;\\
But they said, 'O my daughter,\\
There's nothing but water!'\\
Which vexed that young person in pink.\\

There was an old person of Sheen,\\
Whose expression was calm and serene;\\
He sat in the water,\\
And drank bottled porter,\\
That placid old person of Sheen.\\

There was an old person of Florence,\\
Who held mutton chops in abhorrence;\\
He purchased a bustard,\\
And fried him in mustard,\\
Which choked that old person of Florence.\\

There was an old person of Loo,\\
Who said, 'What on earth shall I do?'\\
When they said, 'Go away!'\\
She continued to stay,\\
That vexatious old person of Loo.\\

There was an old man of Spithead,\\
Who opened the window and said - \\
'Fil-jomble, fil-jumble,\\
Fil-rumble-come-tumble!'\\
That doubtful old man of Spithead.\\

There was an old person of Brigg,\\
Who purchased no end of a Wig;\\
So that only his nose\\
And the end of his toes\\
Could be seen when he waled about Brigg.\\
