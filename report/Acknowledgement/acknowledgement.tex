I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge those who have supported me during this ambitious venture.

Firstly to my supervisor, Dr. William Knottenbelt, for his boundless enthusiasm, optimistic outlook, constant positive reinforcement and light-hearted, hands-off approach that kept me motivated and fearless.

Next, to all those who eagerly and freely participated in my evaluation tests; you made this effort worthwhile.

To the researchers of Computational Linguistics who have done such important work and made their resources openly and easily available.

I am grateful for my close friends, all of whom have inspired me in various walks of life. Each of you have a share in my successes and achievements.

Most of all, I thank my family for their unconditional love and support. You continue to encourage me to follow my own path yet are always there for me when I meet a an obstacle or fork in the road. Such unity gives me peace of mind, the greatest gift I could ever receive.
